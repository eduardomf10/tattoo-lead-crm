# Tattoo Lead CRM API

A REST API for managing clients, leads, notes, and appointments for a solo tattoo artist. Built with **FastAPI**, **SQLAlchemy**, and **Pydantic** as a backend portfolio project demonstrating API design, data modeling, and clean architecture.

---

## Project Overview

This project is an **internal CRM (Customer Relationship Management) API** tailored to the workflow of an independent tattoo artist. It centralizes contact and lead data, tracks inquiry status, stores notes per lead, and manages a single appointment per lead—all through a simple, well-documented REST API.

The codebase follows a layered structure (routers → services → models) with clear separation of concerns, making it a solid example for junior backend roles.

---

## Business Problem

Solo tattoo artists often:

- Receive inquiries via Instagram DMs, email, or referrals with no single place to track them.
- Lose context when switching between conversations (idea, placement, size, budget).
- Forget which leads replied, which are scheduled, and which went cold.
- Rely on spreadsheets or scattered notes, leading to missed follow-ups and lost bookings.

**Pain points:** fragmented data, no pipeline visibility, and manual tracking that doesn’t scale.

---

## Solution

A **REST API** that:

1. **Stores clients** (name, Instagram, phone, email, preferred contact).
2. **Turns inquiries into leads** linked to a client, with tattoo details (idea, location, size, style, source, budget).
3. **Tracks lead status** through a defined pipeline: `new` → `awaiting_client_reply` → `in_conversation` → `scheduled` → `closed` or `lost`.
4. **Attaches notes** to each lead for conversation history and reminders.
5. **Manages one appointment per lead** (date, time, session notes).

The API is stateless, uses SQLite for simplicity and portability, and exposes OpenAPI docs for easy integration with a future frontend or mobile app.

## Features

- **Client management** — Create, list, and retrieve clients by ID.
- **Lead management** — Create leads linked to clients; list with optional status filter; get lead detail (including client); update lead status.
- **Notes** — Create and list notes per lead (nested under `/leads/{lead_id}/notes`).
- **Appointments** — Create or update one appointment per lead; get appointment by lead (returns `null` if none).
- **Automatic docs** — Swagger UI and ReDoc from OpenAPI schema.
- **Structured errors** — 404 and validation errors with clear messages.
- **Database** — SQLite with SQLAlchemy ORM; tables created on startup.

- **Routers** — Handle HTTP, validate input via Pydantic, call services, return responses.
- **Services** — Contain business logic and database operations.
- **Models** — Define tables and relationships; **schemas** define API contracts.

## Database Entities

| Entity       | Table         | Description |
|-------------|---------------|-------------|
| **Client**  | `clients`     | Contact info: `full_name`, `instagram_handle`, `phone`, `email`, `preferred_contact_method`, `created_at`. |
| **Lead**    | `leads`       | One per inquiry; `client_id` (FK); fields: `original_message`, `tattoo_idea`, `body_location`, `size`, `style`, `color_type`, `design_type`, `summary`, `status`, `source`, `estimated_budget_range`; timestamps. |
| **Note**    | `notes`       | `lead_id` (FK), `content`, `created_at`. Many notes per lead. |
| **Appointment** | `appointments` | `lead_id` (FK, unique), `scheduled_date`, `scheduled_time`, `session_notes`, `created_at`. One appointment per lead. |

**Relationships:**

- **Client** → **Lead** (one-to-many).
- **Lead** → **Note** (one-to-many).
- **Lead** → **Appointment** (one-to-one).

Cascade deletes: deleting a client removes its leads; deleting a lead removes its notes and appointment.

## How to Run Locally

**Prerequisites:** Python 3.10+

1. **Clone and enter the project:**

   ```bash
   cd tattoo-lead-crm
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):**

   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   .venv\Scripts\activate   # Windows
   # source .venv/bin/activate   # Linux/macOS
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Start the server:**

   ```bash
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload
   ```

   API base URL: **http://127.0.0.1:8000**

5. **Open the docs:**

   - **Swagger UI:** http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs  
   - **ReDoc:** http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc  

The SQLite database file `tattoo_crm.db` is created automatically in the project root on first request.

---

## Example Workflow

1. **Create a client** (person who inquired):

   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/clients \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"full_name": "Maria Silva", "instagram_handle": "@maria.s", "phone": "+5511999999999", "preferred_contact_method": "instagram"}'
   ```

   Use the returned `id` (e.g. `1`) as `client_id` in the next step.

2. **Create a lead** for the inquiry:

   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/leads \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"client_id": 1, "tattoo_idea": "Flor no braço", "body_location": "braço", "size": "médio", "status": "new", "source": "instagram_dm"}'
   ```

3. **List new leads:**

   ```bash
   curl "http://127.0.0.1:8000/leads?status=new"
   ```

4. **Add a note** to the lead (e.g. lead id `1`):

   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/leads/1/notes \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"content": "Cliente pediu orçamento até sexta."}'
   ```

5. **Update status** when the client replies:

   ```bash
   curl -X PATCH http://127.0.0.1:8000/leads/1/status \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"status": "in_conversation"}'
   ```

6. **Schedule an appointment** (e.g. 2025-04-15 at 14:00):

   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/leads/1/appointment \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"scheduled_date": "2025-04-15", "scheduled_time": "14:00:00", "session_notes": "Sessão 1 - flor braço"}'
   ```

7. **Get full lead detail** (with client and status):

   ```bash
   curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/leads/1
   ```

## Future Improvements

- **Authentication** — JWT or API keys to protect endpoints.
- **Pagination** — Cursor or offset metadata for list endpoints.
- **Filtering and search** — Filter leads by date range, source, or client name; full-text search on notes.
- **PostgreSQL** — Switch from SQLite for production and use connection pooling.
- **Migrations** — Alembic for versioned schema changes.
- **Tests** — Unit tests for services; integration tests for routers (e.g. pytest + TestClient).
- **Soft delete** — Mark leads/clients as deleted instead of hard delete.
- **Audit fields** — `updated_at` on all entities; optional `created_by` if auth is added.
- **Rate limiting** — Per-IP or per-user limits on public endpoints.
- **Frontend** — Simple SPA or mobile app consuming this API.
